# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-SUPERVISED-LEARNING-REGRESSION
Creating machine learning model for house price prediction. Notebook covers Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression.


This project implements Linear Regression to predict house prices based on important features such as area, number of rooms, location-related factors, etc., using a house price dataset. The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on 20%. Performance evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R² score shows reliable prediction accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of supervised learning regression techniques for real-estate price prediction.
